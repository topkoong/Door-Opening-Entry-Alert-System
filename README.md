#Door Opening Entry Alert System
Our project involves constructing a door opening alert system using the Beagle Bone Black. The door opening entry alert system will use a motion sensor to detect movement from a person. Then a webcam captures a photo when somebody opens the door. Afterward, the system will notify the user via email. The email itself will consist of the photo from the webcam and the date and the time of the photo captured. In conclusion, the project will send a photo to the user when a door is opened.

The objective of our project is to create a door opening system with video capture and streaming capabilities. The Platform used for our door opening alert system is the Beagle Bone Black. The planned Operating System for this system is Debian. The communications used in this system is SMTP protocol, email: The door opening alert system will notify the user via email. The email will consist of a photo capture, the date, and the time of the photo capture. The email sends the user the photo captured the moment a person opens the door. The email will be in the userâ€™s inbox in a short time, and so will the video be able to capture to the user in specified time, and the sensors for the Door Opening Entry Alert system can be implemented with a PIR motion detector. Since this system can run for 24 hours per day and 7 days a week, Door Opening Entry Alert System has to be connected to the internet all the time. The relevance to this system is for home security and a piece of mind. The system will notify you if anyone or anything is entering your property at any time. As a result, the user will know who, when and what was messing with your property. Because of its photo capture abilities, it can also be used to identify an individual, and there is an effort to make this system cheap and considering the price of a webcam, motion sensor and breadboard, the cost and the risk for this system is relatively low.
